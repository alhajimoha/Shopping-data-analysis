# Shopping-data-analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing a shopping data set named "shoping_data.csv". The script explores various aspects of the data, including:

Customer Demographics: Analyzes gender distribution and average age.

Purchase Behavior: Examines categories of purchased items, top purchased items, locations of purchases, and sizes of purchased items.

Financial Analysis: Calculates total purchase amount by category, median purchase amount, and average purchase amount based on subscription status.

Review Analysis: Explores the range of review ratings.

Discount Analysis: Looks at the average age of customers who purchased accessories with a discount applied.

Subscription Analysis: Identifies the most common payment method, the number of customers with subscriptions, and the average purchase amount based on subscription status.

## Data Exploration
The project utilizes several data visualization techniques including:

Bar charts to represent categorical data distributions (e.g., gender, category, size).

Pie charts to visualize proportions within categorical data (e.g., gender, category).

Histograms to explore the distribution of continuous data (e.g., age).

## Dependencies
The notebook relies on the following Python libraries:

pandas (pd)

matplotlib.pyplot (plt)

seaborn (sns)
numpy (np)
